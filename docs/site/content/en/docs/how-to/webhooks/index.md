The project uses [Webhooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) to send the messages and events from WhatsApp to your
application.

Webhooks are a way for two different applications to communicate with each other in real-time.
When a certain event happens in one application, it sends a message to another application through a webhook URL.
The receiving application can then take action based on the information received.

To receive incoming messages with webhooks,
you first need to set up a webhook URL in your application and pass it to `WHATSAPP_HOOK_URL` environment variable.
This URL is where WhatsApp will send incoming messages and other events -
define which events you want to receive with `WHATSAPP_HOOK_EVENTS` environment variable.

## Webhooks

You can configure where you want to receive events in environment variables:

- `WHATSAPP_HOOK_URL=https://httpbin.org/post`  - to set up a URL for the webhook
- `WHATSAPP_HOOK_EVENTS=message,message.any,state.change` - specify events. Do not specify all of
  them, it's too heavy payload, choose the right for you.
- `WHATSAPP_HOOK_EVENTS=*` - subscribe to all events. It's not recommended for production, but it's fine for
development.

On the URL that you set via `WHATSAPP_HOOK_URL` you receive JSON-data with following format:

```json
{
  "event": "message",
  "session": "default",
  "engine": "WEBJS",
  "payload": {
    ...
  }
}
```

Where `event` value helps you identify the incoming event with `payload` for that events.

Below the list of all events that WhatsApp HTTP API sends to your.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="If you want to look at a webhook body - use the url https://httpbin.org/post" />}}

Run the bellow command and see look at the logs - it prints body request for all events that happen in your WhatsApp!

```bash
docker run -it -e "WHATSAPP_HOOK_EVENTS=*" -e WHATSAPP_HOOK_URL=https://httpbin.org/post -p 3000:3000 devlikeapro/whatsapp-http-api
```

### Examples
Here's few examples of how to handle webhook in different languages:
1. [Python guide]({{< relref "/docs/examples/python" >}})

**Do you use another language?**

Please create a short guide how to handle webhook and send message after you finish your setup!
You can create a pull request with your favorite language in the
[GitHub, in examples folder ->](https://github.com/devlikeapro/whatsapp-http-api/tree/core/examples).

```json
{
    "event": "presence.update",
    "session": "default",
    "engine": "NOWEB",

                "participant": "11111111111@c.us",
                "lastKnownPresence": "typing",
                "lastSeen": null
            }
