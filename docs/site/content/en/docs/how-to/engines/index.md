Under the hood **WAHA** allows you to use two different engines. You can control what you want to run by settings
`WHATSAPP_DEFAULT_ENGINE` environment variables.

```bash
docker run -it -e "WHATSAPP_DEFAULT_ENGINE=WEBJS" devlikeapro/whatsapp-http-api
```

If you have any problems with one engine - try another!

## WEBJS ![](/images/versions/core.png)

A WhatsApp API client that connects through the WhatsApp Web browser app.
It uses Puppeteer to run a real instance of Whatsapp Web to avoid getting blocked.

**WAHA** uses **WhatsApp WebJS** engine by default.

## NOWEB ![](/images/versions/core.png)

**NOWEB** engine does not require a browser to work with WhatsApp Web, it does so directly using a WebSocket.
Not running Chromium saves you CPU and Memory, so you can run more instances on a single server!

️Working with the engine requires more attention, because it's easy to be blocked with it!

⚠ Read the article before using **NOWEB** engine [How to avoid blocking ->]({{< relref "/docs/help/how-to-avoid-blocking" >}}).
