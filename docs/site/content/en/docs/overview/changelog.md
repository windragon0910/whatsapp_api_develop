## 2023.7
July 2023
- Added [proxy configuration](https://waha.devlike.pro/docs/how-to/config/#proxy) with supporting proxy authentication.
  Thanks **puntolino** for the contribution!

## 2023.6
June 2023

Improvements on session management, restarting sessions and more:

- Added `WHATSAPP_RESTART_ALL_SESSIONS=True`: Set this variable to `True` to start all **STOPPED** sessions after
  container restarts. By default, this variable is set to `False`.
  - Please note that this will start all **STOPPED** sessions, not just the sessions that were working before the
    restart. You can maintain the session list by
    using `POST /api/session/stop` with the `logout: True` parameter or by calling `POST /api/session/logout` to remove
    **STOPPED** sessions. You can see all sessions, including **STOPPED** sessions, in the `GET /api/sessions/all=True`
    response.
- `WHATSAPP_START_SESSION` now support more than one session! Separate session names by command, and it'll start them
  ALWAYS after container restart `WHATSAPP_START_SESSION=session1,session2`
- `WHATSAPP_SWAGGER_CONFIG_ADVANCED=true` enables advanced configuration options for Swagger documentation - you can customize host, port and base URL for the requests.
  Disabled by default.
- Added `?all=true` parameter to `GET /api/session?all=True` endpoint - it'll show you ALL session, included **STOPPED
  **, so you can know which one will be restarted if you set `WHATSAPP_RESTART_ALL_SESSIONS=True` environment variable.
- Added `POST /api/sessions/logout` that allow you to logout from session - remove saved credentials.
- Added `logout` boolean parameter to `POST /api/sessions/stop` request that allow you to stop the session AND logout at
  the same time.
- Added [How to deploy page ->]({{< relref "/docs/how-to/deploy" >}}) with
  [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/devlikeapro/whatsapp-http-api/blob/core/docker-compose.yaml) example
- Added `engine` field in webhook payload

```json
{
  "event": "message",
  "session": "default",
  "engine": "WEBJS",
  "payload": {}
}
```

## 2023.5
May 2023

- Added new [NOWEB engine]({{< relref "/docs/how-to/engines" >}}). **NOWEB** engine does not require a browser to work
  with
  WhatsApp Web, it does so directly using a WebSocket.
  - Less CPU and RAM usage!
  - Send Locations API works!
  - Send Link Preview API works!
  - âš  Read the article before using it [How to avoid blocking ->]({{< relref "/docs/overview/how-to-avoid-blocking" >}}).

## 2023.4
March 2023

- Add [Groups API]({{< relref "/docs/how-to/groups" >}})
- Use Chromium by default instead of Chrome

## 2023.1
January 2023

- Added  [Contacts API]({{< relref "/docs/how-to/contacts" >}})
  - Get all contacts
  - Get a contact
  - Get contact "about" (status)
  - Get contact profile picture
  - Check number exists (is registered in WhatsApp) - works even if the number is not in the contact list
  - Block and unblock contact

## 2022.12
December 2023

- Added `GET /messages/` endpoint to get chat messages [#31](https://github.com/devlikeapro/whatsapp-http-api/issues/31)

### Security ![](/images/versions/plus.png)

- Added `WHATSAPP_SWAGGER_USERNAME` and `WHATSAPP_SWAGGER_PASSWORD` to hide and protect swagger panel.

## 2022.11

**Please test changes in test environment before update production!!**

### Engine ![](/images/versions/core.png)

1. WAHA has changed its underlying engine from Venom to Whatsapp Web.JS. It might change the response and webhook's
   payloads.
2. Optimize CPU and memory consumption.

### Requests ![](/images/versions/core.png)

- For all `/api/session/` requests use `name` field instead of `sessionName`.
- For all "chatting" requests use `session` field instead of `sessionName`.

### Sessions ![](/images/versions/plus.png)

Now you don't have to scan QR code each time you run WAHA, WAHA saves it for you! Available only in Plus version.

### Authentication ![](/images/versions/plus.png)

Now you can authenticate all requests for WAHA - use `WHATSAPP_API_KEY=secret` environment variable to set "secret key".

If `WHATSAPP_API_KEY` is set - requests must have `X-Api-Key` header with `secret` value, where `secret` - any random
secret key.

### Webhooks ![](/images/versions/core.png)

#### Configuration

Instead of setting each webhook via environment variables - we use two environments variables:

- `WHATSAPP_HOOK_URL` - to set a URL
- `WHATSAPP_HOOK_EVENTS` - to set events that are sent to the URL

#### Payload

The data for webhooks are wrapped inside a new `WAWebhook` object with `event` and `payload` fields to help you identify
which handler you should call based on `event`.

```json
{
  "event": "message.any",
  "payload": {
  }
}
```
